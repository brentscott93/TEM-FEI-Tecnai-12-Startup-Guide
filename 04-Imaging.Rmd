# Imaging

This section is the most incomplete of my notes. 

1) Find the surface
    - The beam should already be found and aligned. Use the screen image to try and find an area of sample on the grid. Note if all you see is black you might be over a grid bar. Move around to find a new spot. 

   - Use the "Eucentric focus" to reset to standard height
   - Turn on alpha-wobble
   - Use the z-axis control to move the stage toward the surface. 
   - You will be near focus once the movement of the sample is minimal with alpha wobbler on. 
  
2) Take Pictures
   - The MCSL Server is the Camera (on right monitor).

   - To take picture:
     - Hit "STOP"
     - Select <empty> slot 
      - Hit the camera icon. There are two camers modes. 1) for Live mode viewing and 2) for          taking static images.
