# (a brief) Introduction

This procotol was adapted from the notes I took during TEM training (Summer 2019). This is **not** all encompassing, but rather the bare minimum requirements I needed to initially start the T12, load the sample, find focus (or close to it), and take images.


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/tecnai_t12.png", "images/fei-tecnai-t12.jpg"))
```

Before you start, make sure to **1)** reserve the T12 through UMass FOM ahead of time, and **2)** sign into the T12 on UMass FOM before arriving at the Microscopy Center to initilize startup of the T12 controls.


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
